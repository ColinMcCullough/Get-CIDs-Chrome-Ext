# Get-CIDs-Chrome-Ext
 This extension is designed to be run from a clients overview page in 
 the client hub. It finds all locations CIDs that are not deleted and 
 automatically downloads a csv. The csv is formatted to be uploaded directly
 into the client hub via the bulk csc uploader tool. Open the csv, save the csv,
 and then import the csv.
